# Implementation Report: notebook.oceanheart.ai Phase 00
## Date: 2025-09-12
## PRD: 001-build.prd.md

## Phase Overview
**Phase 00: Core Infrastructure & Database Foundation**
- Priority: Critical Foundation
- Complexity: Medium
- Status: In Progress

## Phases Completed
- [x] Phase 00: Core Infrastructure & Database Foundation
  - Tasks: Project structure, Go modules, SQLite schema, database connection, environment config, health check
  - Commits: TBD (to be added after git commit)

## Testing Summary
- Tests written: 6 test cases
- Tests passing: 6/6
- Manual verification: ✅ Health check endpoint responds correctly

## Implementation Progress
### Completed Tasks
- [x] Read and analyze PRD requirements
- [x] Create implementation report
- [x] Create change log
- [x] Setup Go project structure (cmd/notebook, internal/store, internal/config, migrations)
- [x] Initialize Go modules with SQLite dependency
- [x] Create SQLite migration files (001_init.sql)
- [x] Implement database connection and migration system
- [x] Setup environment configuration management
- [x] Create health check endpoint
- [x] Write tests for core infrastructure

### Phase 00 Success Criteria Met
- ✅ Database creates and migrates successfully
- ✅ Environment variables load correctly
- ✅ Health check returns 200 status
- ✅ Project structure follows specified layout

## Challenges & Solutions
*To be updated as implementation progresses*

## Critical Security Notes
*To be updated as security-related changes are made*

## Next Steps
1. Complete Phase 00 implementation
2. Verify all success criteria are met
3. Proceed to Phase 01: Content Loading & Markdown Processing

## Anti-Over-Engineering Guidelines Applied
- Focus on minimum viable implementation for Phase 00
- Use standard Go patterns and libraries
- Avoid premature optimization
- Implement only specified requirements
