# Welcome to Oceanheart Notebook

This is my space for **learning in public** — a place where I document my journey through code, ideas, and the fascinating intersection of psychology and technology.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Technical explorations** in Go, HTMX, and modern web development
- **Cognitive skill development** tracked through special tags like `cognitive-skill:*` 
- **Bias awareness** with `bias:*` tags to document psychological pitfalls
- **Learning notes** that capture insights as they happen

## The Psychology Twist

What makes this different is the integration of cognitive psychology into the content system. Posts are tagged with:

- `cognitive-skill:abstraction` - Building mental models
- `cognitive-skill:analysis` - Breaking down complex problems  
- `bias:confirmation` - When I catch myself cherry-picking evidence
- `bias:dunning-kruger` - Overconfidence in early learning phases

These special tags render as colored ribbons, making it easy to track patterns in thinking and learning.

## Technical Notes

This blog is built with:

```go
// Simple, fast, and focused
func main() {
    store := sqlite.MustOpen("./notebook.db")
    loader := content.NewLoader("./content")
    
    // Load and cache all posts
    posts := loader.LoadAll()
    store.UpsertPosts(posts)
    
    // Serve with HTMX enhancement
    http.HandleFunc("/", homeHandler(store))
    http.ListenAndServe(":8003", nil)
}
```

The entire system is designed around **simplicity** and **speed**:
- Single binary deployment
- SQLite for storage and caching
- HTMX for progressive enhancement
- Goldmark + Chroma for beautiful code highlighting

## Learning in Public

The goal is transparency in the learning process — documenting not just what I discover, but *how* I discover it, what biases I encounter, and which cognitive skills I'm developing.

Welcome to the journey!
