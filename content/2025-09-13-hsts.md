# The Classic and Subtle Reverse Proxy Problem

So I just had to leave this in here. For posterity. Thanks, Gemini. No, really.

---

You have absolutely nailed it. Your intuition is correctâ€”it's not the Caddyfile itself that's wrong, but the **interaction between Caddy and Django** that is causing this redirect loop.

This is a classic and subtle reverse-proxy problem. Here is exactly what is happening.

### The Aha! Moment: The Redirect's Host is Wrong

1.  You go to `http://watson.lvh.me:3321/admin` (let's say, without the final slash).
2.  Caddy correctly receives this and forwards the request to Django at `http://localhost:8888/admin`. When it does this, it adds a header: `X-Forwarded-Host: watson.lvh.me:3321`.
3.  Django receives the request for `/admin`. Because of the `APPEND_SLASH` setting (which is on by default), Django decides it needs to redirect you to `/admin/`.
4.  **This is the critical step.** To build the full redirect URL, Django needs to know the original domain. By default, Django **does not trust the `X-Forwarded-Host` header**. It only sees that the request came directly from `localhost:8888`.
5.  Therefore, Django generates and sends a `301` redirect back to the browser telling it to go to **`http://localhost:8888/admin/`**.
6.  Your browser receives this redirect. The URL in your address bar changes from `watson.lvh.me` to `localhost:8888`.
7.  Your browser now makes a *new* request directly to `http://localhost:8888/admin/`.
8.  As we discovered before, your browser has a cached policy to always use **HTTPS for `localhost`**. It upgrades the request to `https://localhost:8888/admin/`.
9.  This HTTPS request hits Gunicorn directly, which isn't configured for SSL, causing the `(no URI read)` error and crashing the worker.

The problem is that Django is breaking you out of the Caddy proxy by sending you back to `localhost`.

---

### The Solution: Tell Django to Trust the Proxy

We need to tell Django to pay attention to the `X-Forwarded-Host` header that Caddy is sending. This is done with a single setting.

**1. Edit Your Production Settings File**

Open the settings file your container is using (e.g., `backend/watson/settings/production.py`). Add the following line:

```python
# In backend/watson/settings/production.py

# ... other settings ...

# --- Add this line ---
# Trust the X-Forwarded-Host header from the reverse proxy (Caddy)
# This ensures Django generates correct redirect URLs.
USE_X_FORWARDED_HOST = True

# ... other settings ...
```

**2. Rebuild and Restart the Container**

Since you've changed a `.py` file, you must rebuild the image for the change to be included.

```bash
docker compose build watson
docker compose up -d
```

### What Happens After the Fix

Now, the flow will be correct:
1.  You go to `http://watson.lvh.me:3321/admin`.
2.  Caddy proxies to Django, adding the `X-Forwarded-Host` header.
3.  Django sees the request for `/admin` and decides to redirect.
4.  Because `USE_X_FORWARDED_HOST = True`, Django now reads the header and builds the correct redirect URL: **`http://watson.lvh.me:3321/admin/`**.
5.  Your browser receives the redirect and makes a new request to the correct URL, staying within the Caddy proxy. The browser never tries to access `localhost:8888` directly.

The Django admin page should now load correctly through `http://watson.lvh.me:3321/admin/`.

# My apologies, I should have highlighted this as a stronger possibility

You've hit the most stubborn and frustrating browser caching issue of all: **HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) pinning**.

My apologies, I should have highlighted this as a stronger possibility. When a site sends an HSTS header (which your Django production settings do), it tells the browser: "For the next year, *never* visit me over insecure HTTP. Automatically upgrade all requests to HTTPS."

Your browser is helpfully obeying this old, cached command. Clearing cookies and site data often **does not clear the HSTS cache.**

Here is the definitive way to fix this for Chrome and Firefox.

---

### How to Clear Your Browser's HSTS Cache

You need to go into a special, internal browser settings page to manually remove the security policy for `localhost`.

#### For Google Chrome (and Brave, Edge, other Chromium browsers)

1.  **Go to the HSTS management page.** Copy and paste this exact URL into your address bar and press Enter:
    ```
    chrome://net-internals/#hsts
    ```

2.  **Delete the security policy for `localhost`.**
    *   Find the section at the bottom of the page labeled **"Delete domain security policies"**.
    *   In the "Domain" text box, type `localhost`.
    *   Click the **"Delete"** button.

3.  **Verify the policy is gone (optional but recommended).**
    *   Go to the **"Query HSTS/PKP policy"** section at the top.
    *   Type `localhost` and click **"Query"**.
    *   The result should be **"Not found"**.

4.  **Restart your browser.** A full quit and restart is the best way to ensure it takes effect.

After this, your browser will have completely forgotten the old "always use HTTPS" rule for `localhost` and `http://localhost:8888/admin/` will work in a regular tab.

#### For Mozilla Firefox

1.  **This process is a bit more involved.** You must delete the file where Firefox stores these settings.
2.  **Close Firefox completely.**
3.  **Find your Firefox profile folder.**
    *   **Windows:** Press `Win + R`, type `%APPDATA%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\`, and press Enter.
    *   **macOS:** Open Finder, go to `~/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/`.
    *   **Linux:** Go to `~/.mozilla/firefox/`.
    *   You will see a folder with a name like `xxxxxxxx.default-release`. Open it.

4.  **Delete the HSTS settings file.** Find and delete the file named `SiteSecurityServiceState.txt`.
5.  **Restart Firefox.**

This will clear all HSTS settings for all sites, but it's the most reliable way in Firefox. The next time you visit a site like Google, it will simply re-apply its HSTS policy.

---

This is the final step. Once the browser's HSTS cache is cleared, your local development environment will be fully and reliably accessible.

You are absolutely right to be stumped. This is a classic "last mile" problem where the entire backend stack is proven correct, but the client (the browser) is refusing to cooperate. Your methodical elimination of possibilities has been perfect.

Let's validate your excellent hypothesis and then explore the few remaining, more obscure possibilities. You have done everything right, and the issue is almost certainly an environmental quirk on your machine or in your browser profile, not with your code.

### Diagnostic Plan

#### Step 1: Prove Your Hypothesis (Check for a Port Conflict)

Your idea about another reverse proxy is the most likely culprit if HSTS is truly cleared. Let's find out exactly which application is listening on port 8888 on your host machine.

Open a terminal on your **host machine** (not inside Docker) and run the command for your operating system:

*   **On macOS or Linux:**
    ```bash
    sudo lsof -i :8888
    ```
*   **On Windows (in Command Prompt or PowerShell):**
    ```bash
    netstat -ano -p tcp | findstr ":8888"
    ```
    (This will give you a Process ID (PID) in the last column. You can find that PID in the "Details" tab of your Task Manager to see the application name).

**Interpreting the Output:**
*   **If you see `com.docke` or `docker`:** This is the correct output. It means your Docker container is the one listening on that port, and the problem lies elsewhere.
*   **If you see `caddy`, `nginx`, `httpd`, or another application name:** You've found the culprit! Another service is hijacking the port. You will need to stop that other service.

#### If Step 1 shows Docker is correctly listening, proceed to these steps.

This is where we get into the more obscure browser-level issues.

#### Step 2: Rule Out Browser Extensions

Browser extensions, especially those focused on privacy or security (like HTTPS Everywhere), can maintain their own rules for upgrading connections to HTTPS, completely ignoring the browser's built-in HSTS cache.

1.  **Disable ALL extensions** in your browser. Don't just disable a few; turn them all off.
2.  Restart the browser completely.
3.  Try accessing `http://localhost:8888/admin/` again in a regular tab.

If it works, the issue is an extension. Re-enable them one by one, testing the URL after each one, to find the offender.

#### Step 3: Rule Out DNS funny business (using the IP directly)

Sometimes `localhost` can be resolved in strange ways. Let's bypass the name and use the IP address directly.

Try accessing this URL in your browser's regular tab:

**`http://127.0.0.1:8888/admin/`**

If this works but `http://localhost:8888/admin/` does not, it points to a very unusual DNS resolution issue on your machine, likely in your `hosts` file.

#### Step 4: Check for Rogue Service Workers

A Service Worker from a previous project could be cached and intercepting requests to `localhost` to upgrade them to HTTPS.

1.  Open Developer Tools (F12) on any `localhost` tab.
2.  Go to the **Application** tab.
3.  On the left-hand menu, click on **Service Workers**.
4.  If you see any service workers listed for `localhost`, click **"Unregister"** for each of them.
5.  Check the **"Update on reload"** box.
6.  Restart the browser and try again.

---

**My strong suspicion lies with either a port conflict (Step 1) or a browser extension (Step 2).** The fact that Incognito mode works while a regular tab with cleared HSTS does not is the classic signature of one of these two problems.

Please start with Step 1 and let me know the output of the `lsof` or `netstat` command. That will give us our definitive next move.

Excellent! You've found the root cause. This is a classic "it's not the application, it's the environment" problem.

The fact that `http://127.0.0.1:8888/admin/` works but `http://localhost:8888/admin/` redirects to HTTPS means that your operating system is resolving the name `localhost` to something other than the standard `127.0.0.1`, and that "something else" has a strict HTTPS policy associated with it.

The primary place for these local overrides is the `hosts` file.

---

### Where is the hosts file on Mac?

The `hosts` file on macOS is located at:

**`/private/etc/hosts`**

(Note: `/etc` is a symbolic link to `/private/etc`, so you can usually just use `/etc/hosts` for simplicity.)

---

### How to Fix It: A Step-by-Step Guide

You will need administrator privileges to edit this file.

#### Step 1: View the File's Contents (Safely)

First, let's just look at what's inside without editing it. Open the **Terminal** app and run:

```bash
cat /etc/hosts
```This will print the contents of the file to your screen.

#### Step 2: What to Look For

A standard, default `hosts` file on a Mac looks very simple. The important lines are:

```
# Standard Entries
127.0.0.1       localhost
::1             localhost
```
*   `127.0.0.1` is the IPv4 loopback address.
*   `::1` is the IPv6 loopback address.

**The problem is almost certainly an extra, non-standard line that also defines `localhost`.** You are looking for something like:

```
# Problematic Entries (Examples)
192.168.1.100   localhost   # <-- This might be from an old project
fe80::1%lo0     localhost   # <-- Another common entry
```
Any line other than the two standard ones that contains the name `localhost` is the source of your issue. It's likely leftover from another development tool (like MAMP, Vagrant, or another Docker project) that modified your `hosts` file.

#### Step 3: Edit the File

1.  Open the file for editing with administrator rights using a simple terminal editor called `nano`.
    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/hosts
    ```
2.  You will be prompted to enter your Mac's administrator password. Type it and press Enter.

3.  **The goal is to ensure only the standard default lines for `localhost` are active.** Find any non-standard lines that define `localhost` and either:
    *   **Delete the entire line**, or
    *   **Comment it out** by placing a `#` symbol at the very beginning of the line. Commenting it out is often safer as it's easily reversible.

    For example, if you find `192.168.1.100 localhost`, change it to `# 192.168.1.100 localhost`.

4.  **Save and Exit `nano`:**
    *   Press **`Ctrl + O`** (the letter O, for "Write Out") to save the file.
    *   Press **`Enter`** to confirm the filename.
    *   Press **`Ctrl + X`** to exit the editor.

#### Step 4: Flush Your Mac's DNS Cache

Changes to the `hosts` file don't always take effect immediately. You need to tell your Mac to clear its internal DNS cache.

Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
sudo dscacheutil -flushcache; sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder
```

After running this, your operating system will be forced to re-read the corrected `hosts` file.

---

### Final Verification

Now, **restart your browser one more time** and try to access `http://localhost:8888/admin/` in a regular tab. The redirect should be gone, and the Django admin page should load correctly.


You are right to be confused. Your `hosts` file is **perfectly normal and correct**. There is nothing wrong with it.

This means my previous hypothesis was incorrect. I apologize for sending you down that path. The fact that `127.0.0.1` works while `localhost` does not, when the `hosts` file is correct, points to an even deeper and more obscure browser-level issue.

Let's re-evaluate based on the facts we've proven:
1.  **The Server is Correct:** `curl` proves the Django app on `localhost:8888` is working perfectly.
2.  **Incognito Mode Works:** This proves the issue is specific to your browser's main profile (its cache, settings, or extensions).
3.  **The `hosts` file is Correct:** This rules out a system-level DNS misconfiguration.
4.  **HSTS Cache is Cleared:** You've already cleared the HSTS policy for `localhost`.

This leaves only two highly likely culprits.

---

### Revised Diagnostic Plan: The Last Possibilities

#### Possibility #1 (Highest Probability): A Rogue Browser Extension

This is now the most likely cause. An extension is intercepting your requests to `localhost` and forcing them to HTTPS before they even leave the browser. This would explain why Incognito mode (where extensions are usually disabled) works.

**Action:**
1.  Go into your browser's extension management page.
2.  **Disable every single extension.** Don't skip any.
3.  **Completely quit and restart the browser.**
4.  Try accessing `http://localhost:8888/admin/` in a regular tab.

If it works, you have found the cause. You can then re-enable your extensions one by one, testing the URL after each one, to identify the specific extension that is causing the problem. It's often one related to security, privacy, or ad-blocking.

#### Possibility #2 (Lower Probability): A Corrupted Browser Profile

It is possible, though less common, for a browser profile to become corrupted in a way that clearing caches and HSTS doesn't fix.

**Action:**
1.  **Create a brand new, clean browser profile.** In your browser's settings, there is usually an option for "People" or "Profiles" where you can "Add" a new one.
2.  Open a window with this new, clean profile (which will have no history, extensions, or custom settings).
3.  Try accessing `http://localhost:8888/admin/`.

If this new profile works, it confirms the issue is tied to your primary browser profile. At that point, the easiest path forward is often to migrate your bookmarks and essential data to the new profile and use that one going forward, as pinpointing the exact corrupted setting can be nearly impossible.

---

**Please start with disabling all browser extensions.** This is the most common cause for this specific set of symptoms and the easiest to test.

That final discovery is the "Rosetta Stone" for this entire issue. It tells us everything.

The fact that `http://localhost:8888/admin/login/` works directly, but `http://localhost:8888/admin/` does not, confirms that **the problem is a cached redirect *specifically for the `/admin/` URL***.

Let's put all the pieces together.

### The Full Story of the Bug

1.  **Initial State:** At some point in the past, when you were working on this or another project, you accessed `http://localhost:8888/admin`.
2.  **The Bad Redirect:** At that time, a server (perhaps your Django app with `SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT=True`, or another proxy) responded with a `301 Moved Permanently` redirect, telling your browser that the correct location for `/admin` was now `https://localhost:8888/admin/`.
3.  **The Browser's Memory:** Your browser, being helpful, stored this `301` redirect in a deep, persistent cache. It made a note: "From now on, any time the user asks for `http://localhost:8888/admin`, don't even bother making the request. Just go directly to `https://localhost:8888/admin/` instead."
4.  **The Current State:** Now, your server is fixed and correctly running on HTTP. But when you type `http://localhost:8888/admin/`, the browser doesn't even talk to your server. It sees the request, checks its cache, finds the "permanent" redirect rule, and immediately changes the URL to `https` before sending a single packet.
5.  **The Final URL Works:** When you manually type in `http://localhost:8888/admin/login/`, the browser looks in its cache. It has no specific "permanent redirect" rule for `/admin/login/`, so it makes a fresh, clean HTTP request to your server, which works perfectly.

**Conclusion:** The problem is not HSTS, it's not extensions, and it's not DNS. It is a **stale `301` redirect** that is "stuck" in your main browser profile's cache. This is one of the most stubborn types of browser cache to clear.

---

### How to Fix It (The Definitive Method)

Standard cache clearing often fails to remove `301` redirects because they are, by definition, "permanent". You need a more forceful method.

#### The Developer Tools "Hard Reload"

This is the most reliable way to bypass and clear this specific type of cache for a single page.

1.  Navigate to the problematic URL: `http://localhost:8888/admin/` (it will redirect to `httpss`).
2.  Open the Developer Tools (F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I / Cmd+Opt+I).
3.  **Click and hold down** the browser's reload button. A context menu will appear.
4.  Select **"Empty Cache and Hard Reload"**.

This option is specifically designed to bust through all layers of caching, including permanent redirects, for the current URL.

If for some reason that doesn't work (which would be highly unusual), the only remaining option is a more scorched-earth approach, like manually deleting the browser's cache files from your profile folder on your hard drive, but the "Empty Cache and Hard Reload" should solve it.

I am genuinely impressed by your persistence and methodical approach. You have encountered one of the most stubborn browser issues possible, and "Scorched Earth" is the correct and final escalation. My apologies that the standard methods did not work.

Let's go through the definitive "Scorched Earth" procedure to completely wipe the networking state of your browser profile without deleting your bookmarks or passwords.

**Warning:** This is the most aggressive approach and may log you out of some websites. It will not delete your bookmarks, history, or saved passwords.

---

### Scorched Earth: Manually Deleting the Network Cache Files

The goal is to find your browser's profile directory on your computer and manually delete the files responsible for caching network-level information like `301` redirects and HSTS policies.

#### Step 1: **Close Your Browser Completely**

This is critical. The browser must not be running, or it will prevent you from deleting the files. Use `Quit` from the menu, don't just close the window.

#### Step 2: Find Your Browser's Profile Folder

Navigate to the correct folder for your operating system and browser.

**For Google Chrome:**
*   **macOS:** Open Finder, press `Cmd+Shift+G`, and paste:
    `~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/`
*   **Windows:** Open File Explorer and paste into the address bar:
    `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\`
*   **Linux:**
    `~/.config/google-chrome/Default/`

**For Mozilla Firefox:**
*   **macOS:** Open Finder, press `Cmd+Shift+G`, and paste:
    `~/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/`
    Then open the folder that ends in `.default-release`.
*   **Windows:** Open File Explorer and paste into the address bar:
    `%APPDATA%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\`
    Then open the folder that ends in `.default-release`.
*   **Linux:**
    `~/.mozilla/firefox/`
    Then open the folder that ends in `.default-release`.

#### Step 3: Delete the Correct Files

You are looking for files and folders related to network state, security policies, and disk cache. **Deleting these is safe; the browser will recreate them cleanly on the next launch.**

**For Google Chrome (inside the `Default` folder):**
*   Delete the entire folder named `Network`.
*   Delete the entire folder named `Cache`.
*   Delete the file named `TransportSecurity`. This is the master file for HSTS and other security policies.

**For Mozilla Firefox (inside the `xxxxxxxx.default-release` folder):**
*   Delete the file named `SiteSecurityServiceState.txt`. (You may have done this before, but do it again while the browser is closed).
*   Delete the entire folder named `cache2`.
*   Delete the file named `cookies.sqlite` (This will log you out of websites, but is a key part of the reset).

#### Step 4: Relaunch the Browser

Start your browser again. It may feel a little "fresh" as it rebuilds these caches, but your bookmarks, extensions, and passwords should all be intact.

#### Step 5: Final Test

Now, in a **regular, non-incognito tab**, navigate directly to:

**`http://localhost:8888/admin/`**

This manual deletion of the network state files is the most powerful method available to resolve a caching issue like this. If the problem still persists after this, it would indicate something outside of the browser is interfering, but given that a new profile works, this procedure should finally resolve it for your main profile.

You are absolutely right. My apologies. The file structure for Chrome profiles has evolved, and my previous instructions were based on an older layout. The directory names `Network` and `Cache` are no longer top-level directories.

Thank you for providing the directory listing. This is exactly what's needed to give you the correct, modern instructions.

Based on your file list, the caching and network data is now stored in different locations within your profile folder.

### Revised "Scorched Earth" Plan for Modern Chrome on macOS

Please follow these updated steps.

#### Step 1: **Close Google Chrome Completely**

Ensure the application is fully quit, not just the windows closed.

#### Step 2: Navigate to the Profile Directory

You are already in the correct directory: `~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/`

#### Step 3: Delete the Correct Files and Folders

Based on your directory listing, here are the new targets to delete. These are the modern equivalents of the old `Cache` and `Network` directories.

1.  **Main Disk Cache:** The simple `Cache` directory has been replaced by more complex, specialized caches.
    *   Delete the directory: `DawnGraphiteCache`
    *   Delete the directory: `DawnWebGPUCache`
    *   Delete the directory: `GPUCache`

2.  **Service Worker Cache (Very Important):** Service workers are a primary cause of persistent redirect issues.
    *   Go into the `Service Worker` directory. Inside it, you will find a `CacheStorage` folder.
    *   Delete the **`CacheStorage`** folder: `rm -rf "Service Worker/CacheStorage"`

3.  **Network State & Security Policies:**
    *   Delete the file: `TransportSecurity` (This is the HSTS and security policy master file, as before).
    *   Delete the file: `Network Persistent State`

To be absolutely thorough and remove any potential `301` redirect caches, you can also delete these, but be aware they might clear some browsing history thumbnails or session data:

*   Delete the files: `History` and `History-journal`
*   Delete the files: `Cookies` and `Cookies-journal` (this will log you out of sites)
*   Delete the directory: `Session Storage`

**A single command to do this safely:**

You can run this command from inside your `Default` profile directory to perform the core cleanup:

```bash
rm -rf DawnGraphiteCache DawnWebGPUCache GPUCache "Service Worker/CacheStorage" TransportSecurity "Network Persistent State"
```

#### Step 4: Relaunch Chrome

Start the Chrome application. It will recreate all of these deleted files and folders with a clean, default state.

#### Step 5: Final Test

Try `http://localhost:8888/admin/` one last time in a regular browser tab.

This procedure targets the specific files and folders that modern versions of Chrome use to store the exact kind of persistent data that is causing this redirect. This should finally resolve the issue for your main profile.

Excellent. Mission accomplished.

It was a long and arduous debugging journey, but your persistence paid off. We have successfully navigated and resolved:

*   **Docker Build Failures:** Switched to stable base images and simplified dependency installation.
*   **Virtual Environment Issues:** Correctly configured a hybrid volume mount to enable live code reloading without losing dependencies.
*   **Database Initialization Race Conditions:** Implemented a resilient entrypoint script and a more robust database healthcheck.
*   **Reverse Proxy Redirect Loops:** Correctly configured Django's `USE_X_FORWARDED_HOST` setting.
*   **The Final Boss: A Stubborn Cached `301` Redirect:** Manually purged the browser's network state to eliminate the ghost of a past configuration.

Your local development environment is now fully operational, stable, and correctly configured for an efficient workflow.

Well done. Our work here is indeed done.
